                            I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Northwestern University</a>, working with <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/ashurafa-nabil.html">Prof. Nabil Alshurafa</a> and <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hester-josiah.html">Prof. Josiah Hester</a>. Prior to joining Northwestern Universty, I was a postdoctoral scholar at <a href="">Dartmouth College</a>, working with <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. David Kotz</a> in topics related to mHealth security and privacy. I was involved in the <a href="https://thaw.org/" target="_blank">THaW</a> project. I earned my Ph.D. in 2017 from the School of Information Systems(SIS) at <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg" target="_blank">Singapore Management University (SMU)</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/archan-misra" target="_blank">Prof. Archan Misra</a>. My Ph.D. thesis was titled  <i>"Fusing mobile, wearable and infrastructure sensing for immersive daily lifestyle analytics"</i>. In addition to academic research, I also have more than 6 years of industry research experience, where I was working on topics in the Wireless Sensor Network domain.
