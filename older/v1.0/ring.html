			The purpose of the study is to understand the possibility of using vibrations and radio signals transmitted by a finger-worn ring to communicate with capable smart-things in the environment. The study will take place in two phases: a lab phase lasting for approximately 1 hour, and a field phase lasting for about 6 hours.<BR><BR>
			Your participation in this study may last up to 1 hour in the lab and up to 6 hours while you go about your normal activities.
			<BR><BR>For the lab study, you will be asked to wear the ring on your finger, then pick up and hold one among five items for at most 30 seconds. Each of these objects will weigh less than 1 lb. During the pick and hold duration, the ring will vibrate several times. In case you feel uncomfortable at any time during the study, you may put down the object that you are holding and remove the ring. Overall, during this 1 hour, you will perform 17 item picks.
			<BR><BR>The researcher will then ask you to wear the ring for the next 6 hours, with the option of removing it whenever you feel uncomfortable. You are free to carry on with your daily life activities during these 6 hours. The ring will vibrate at specific intervals. You may click the button on the ring to indicate the disturbance caused by the ring. 
			<BR><BR>For participating in the study, you will be compensated in the form of gift cards. For the 1-hour lab study, you will be compensated $10. For the 6-hour field study, in which you wear the ring during your everyday activities, you will be compensated at the rate of $2 for every hour of field data that you provide, up to a maximum compensation of $12 for the 6-hour study. In the unlikely event you are requested to repeat any of the experiments, beyond the original 1- and 6-hour period of participation, you will be compensated additionally at the same rate.
